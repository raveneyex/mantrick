# Mantrick
An intention-based mantra generator.

# How to use
Just run `mantrick "an intent or desire in the affirmative present tense"` and the application will give you a mantra.

Some of the transformations used for generating the mantra require a number called `seed`, this may be supplied as a parameter using the `-s` flag: `mantric "an intent or desire in the affirmative present tense" -s 666`.

Note that `-s` is expected to be a number and an error will be thrown if this is found not to be.

# FAQ

#### 1. What is a mantra?
Much and more have been written about mantras, but in their broader meaning a _mantra_ is a word used to focus during meditation. 

#### 2. What's the goal here?
To generate a mantra that when used during meditation acts as a focal point for the materialization of the _will_.

Think of the result of this application as a _verbal *sigil* or *servitor*_, if that makes any sense to you.

#### 3. Does this shit works?
The jury is still out on the effectiveness of mantras, _sigil-magick_, and magick in general.

I, personally, find it very effective if done properly. Others do too.

The only way for you to know is to generate a mantra and start using it during meditation.

#### 4. Is this Satanic?
It is if you want it to be.

#### 5. Will I condemn my soul if I use this?
You will if you believe so. Otherwise you're golden.

#### 6. This sound interesting, where can I learn more?
I would encourage you to read about _chaos magick_, _sigil magick_, and _technomancy_.

#### 7. You are an awesome techno-shaman and I have the hots for you. Will you have me?
Ask my gf if she'll have you. If she does, I do too.
