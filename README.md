# Mantrick
An intention-based mantra generator.

# How to use
1. Install dependencies - `npm i`
2. Run the app with `mantrick "an intent or desire in the affirmative present tense"`
3. Some of the transformations used for generating the mantra require a number called `seed`, this may be supplied as a parameter using the `-s` flag: `mantric "an intent or desire in the affirmative present tense" -s 666`.  
Note that `-s` is expected to be a number and an error will be thrown if this is found not to be.

# FAQ

#### 1. What is a mantra?
Much and more have been written about mantras, but in their broader meaning a _mantra_ is a word used to focus during meditation. 

#### 2. What's the goal here?
To generate a mantra that when used during meditation acts as a focal point for the materialization of the _will_.  
Think of the result of this application as a _verbal **sigil**_ or _**servitor**_, if that makes any sense to you.

#### 3. Does this shit works?
The jury is still out on the effectiveness of mantras, _sigil-magick_, and magick in general.  
I, personally, find it very effective if done properly. Others do too.  
The only way for you to know is to generate a mantra and start using it during meditation.

#### 4. Is this Satanic?
It is if you want it to be.

#### 5. Will I condemn my soul if I use this?
You will if you believe so. Otherwise you're golden.

#### 6. This sound interesting, where can I learn more?
I would encourage you to read about _chaos magick_, _sigil magick_, and _technomancy_.

#### 7. You are an awesome techno-shaman and I have the hots for you. Will you have me?
Ask my gf if she'll have you. If she does, I do too.

# Dedications

I dedicate this little app to:

1. The _God of Magick_, in whatever form and name he might take. Hail, Hermes!
2. The _Prince of Darkness_, in whatever form and name he might take. Hail, _Horned Lord_!
3. Myself, and the Black Flame that burns inside me and makes it possible for me to get inspired and do magick.
